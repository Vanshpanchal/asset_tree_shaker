# Asset Tree Shaker Configuration Example
# https://github.com/your-org/asset_tree_shaker
#
# Copy this file to your project root and rename to:
# - asset_tree_shaker.yaml (recommended)
# - .asset_tree_shaker.yaml (hidden file)

# ============================================================================
# SCAN CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Directories to scan for Dart files (relative to project root)
# Default: ['lib/']
scan_paths:
          - lib/

# Include test directory in scan
# Default: false
include_tests: false

# Include generated files (.g.dart, .freezed.dart, etc.)
# Default: true
include_generated_files: true

# ============================================================================
# ASSET DETECTION
# ============================================================================

# Additional asset path prefixes to recognize in string literals
# Default: ['assets/', 'packages/']
asset_prefixes:
          - assets/
          - packages/
          # Add custom prefixes if you use non-standard asset paths:
          # - images/
          # - resources/

# ============================================================================
# EXCLUSIONS & WHITELIST
# ============================================================================

# Glob patterns for assets to exclude from analysis
# Assets matching these patterns will be marked as "whitelisted" and not
# reported as unused. Use for assets you know are needed but can't be detected.
exclude_patterns:
          # Generated assets (e.g., from build tools)
          # - "assets/generated/**"

          # Placeholder/fallback images
          # - "assets/placeholders/**"

          # Third-party assets
          # - "assets/vendor/**"

# Annotation names that mark assets as required
# These annotations can be placed on classes/functions that use dynamic assets
# Default: ['KeepAsset', 'KeepAssets', 'PreserveAsset']
keep_annotations:
          - KeepAsset
          - KeepAssets
          - PreserveAsset

# ============================================================================
# DYNAMIC ASSET PATTERNS
# ============================================================================

# Known dynamic asset patterns to whitelist
# Use when assets are loaded dynamically (e.g., 'assets/avatars/$id.png')
# The tool will detect some patterns automatically, but you can add known ones here.
dynamic_patterns:
          # User avatars loaded by ID
          # - "assets/avatars/*.png"

          # Locale files loaded based on device settings
          # - "assets/locales/*.json"

          # Level/game assets loaded dynamically
          # - "assets/levels/level_*.json"
          # - "assets/sprites/character_*.png"

# ============================================================================
# CI/CD INTEGRATION
# ============================================================================

# Fail the build if unused assets are found (CI/CD mode)
# Default: false
strict_mode: false

# ============================================================================
# REPORTING
# ============================================================================

# Generate a report file after analysis
# Default: true
generate_report: true

# Report format: markdown, json, or html
# Default: markdown
report_format: markdown
# Custom report output path (optional)
# Default: asset_report.md (or .json/.html based on format)
# report_output_path: "reports/asset_report.md"
